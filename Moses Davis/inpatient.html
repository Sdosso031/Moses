        <h1>Our Patients</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to Health Care. As a connected system with more than 900 locations throughout the Carolinas, our goal is   to bring healthcare to our patients whenever and wherever they need us. We&rsquo;ve provided some information we hope
            you&rsquo;ll find helpful as we work together.
        </p>   
        <h2>Hospital Visiting Hours</h2>
        <p>Visiting hours differ from location to location. It also depends on the condition of the patients</p>
        <h2>Patient Experience</h2>
         <p>   
            Our patients are at the center of everything we do. We listen to our patients and their families and strive to meet your needs by providing patient-centered care that keeps you safe, promotes your healing, and includes, informs and inspires you. Health Care does this in many ways, and a few are featured here. 
        </p>  
        <h2>Hospital Visitor Policies</h2>
        <p>
             We know how important it can be to have someone by your side when you seek medical care. As we navigate each new phase of the coronavirus (or COVID-19) pandemic, Health Care is continually reevaluating our visitor policies. And we're setting the national standard for COVID-Safe care, with enhanced safety measures across all locations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before your next visit, please review our latest visitor policies, restrictions and exceptions. If you have any questions or concerns, your care team is here to help.
        </p>
