        <h1>OutPatients Clinic</h1>
        <p>
            The Department will periodically contact patients waiting for an outpatient clinic appointment via SMS, with a link to an electronic form.  This is part of routine waitlist auditing to ensure patient details are up to date.  If you receive this SMS, please update your details. <br>
            One in ten patients fails to attend their appointment.
            This causes delays not only in treating you, but in treating other patients too. If you fail to attend your appointment you may be dischargedLink to an external website from the Outpatient Clinic. This means that for you to return to clinic a new referral letter will be required.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Change of Contact details
        </h2>
        <p>
            If your contact details change - address or phone number - please contact the specific clinic that you are to attend from the list on the Outpatient ClinicLink to an external website page. This will make sure you receive important information about your appointment.
        </p>
        <h2>Obtaining an appointment</h2>
        <p>
            Appointments for Outpatient ClinicsLink to an external website are by referral from your GP, specialist, other health professional or as requested prior to discharge from hospital.  In the referral letter, information will have been provided about the reason for your referral.  Note: Self-referral is possible for some clinics.

            A health professional reviews the referral and prioritises your appointment based on this information. You might receive an appointment date straight away or be placed on a waiting list to receive an appointment at a later date.

            If your appointment is delayed, you may wish to speak to the person who referred you to discuss other treatment options. If your condition changes or you have any health problems while waiting for your appointment, please see your GP or the person that referred you.
        </p>
        <h2>Notification about appointment</h2>
        <p>
            A letter will be sent to you either offering an appointment or advising that your name has been placed on a wait list. You may receive other letters relating to your appointment if necessary. For some Outpatient Clinics an SMS reminder will be sent if you have provided a mobile number.
